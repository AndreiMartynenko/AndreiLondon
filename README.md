Hello! My name is Andrei ðŸ‘‹.

I'm a developer that loves simplifying things. 
I love breaking down complex problems into simple, easy to understand solutions. 
I currently live in London as a software developer. ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m intresting to learn Golang, JS, Rust. In my spare time, I produce music using Ableton Live.
